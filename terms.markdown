You grant ProLocker and our users a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide license to use, store, display, reproduce, save, modify, create derivative works, perform, and distribute your User Content on ProLocker solely for the purposes of operating, developing, providing, and using the ProLocker Products.

**More simply put:**
If we are sued because of something your business does on ProLocker, you have to pay our costs. Also, you should have created a business account and agreed to our commercial terms in the first place.

##8. Disclaimers

The Products and all included content are provided on an "as is" basis without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied.

ProLocker SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.

You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose.

**More simply put:**
Unfortunately, people post bad stuff on user-generated content sites like ProLocker. We take that kind of thing seriously but you still might run into it before we have a chance to take it down. If you see bad stuff, please report it to us.

##9. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ProLocker SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE PRODUCTS; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.

**More simply put**:
We are building the best service we can for you but we can't promise it will be perfect. We're not liable for various things. If you think we are, let's try to work it out like adults.

##10. Arbitration

For any dispute you have with ProLocker, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. If ProLocker has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. Unless you and ProLocker agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, except that ProLocker will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Service. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND ProLocker ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

To the extent any claim, dispute or controversy regarding ProLocker or our Products isn’t arbitrable under applicable laws or otherwise: you and ProLocker both agree that any claim or dispute regarding ProLocker will be resolved exclusively in accordance with Clause 11 of these Terms.

##11. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. We each agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a provincial court located in Toronto, Ontario, for any actions not subject to Section 10 (Arbitration).

**More simply put:**
You'll have to sue us in Toronto.

##12. General Terms

Notification procedures and changes to these Terms. ProLocker reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, and you agree to receive legal notices electronically if we so choose. We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version will always be posted on our website. If a revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you. By continuing to access or use the Products after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Products.
 	
**More simply put:**
If we're making a big change to the terms, we'll let you know.

Entire Agreement/Severability. These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with ProLocker in connection with the Products, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and ProLocker concerning the Products. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

No Waiver. No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and ProLocker's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
